# Portfolio

These are my projects in which I showcase issues, techniques and codes. 

The codes are greatly reduced for different reasons such as anonymization, practicality, etc. In actuality, these codes tend to be longer and with more moving parts, however, you can still see the main section of the projects. 
In this portfolio mostly you will find my codes in python or R. I have other projects in excel that are not included because of the disparity of complexity (Financial analysis vs Bot).

Feel free to contact me in concern about this portfolio.
