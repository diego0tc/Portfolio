# Portfolio

This are my personal projects in which i showcase issues, techniques and codes. 

The codes are greatly reduce for differents reason such as anonymization, practicality, etc. It tend to be longer and with more moving parts, however, you can still see the main section of the projects. 
In this portfolio mostly you will find my codes in python or R. I have other projects in excel that are not included because of the disperity of complexity (Financial analysis vs Bot).

Feel free to contact me in concern to this portfolio.
